== animation

Utility for creating animations from a series of images
[[toc:]]
=== {{make-animator}}
<procedure>(make-animator #!key (magnitude 10000) (frames-per-second 4) (type png)) → Two values: next-frame and finalize</procedure>
Create an animator, which consists of two values: a frame-creator and a finalizer.

{{Next-frame}} is a niladic function which returns the filename
of the next frame; {{finalize}} is a monadic function taking the
basename of the animation (e.g. {{graph}} → {{graph.avi}}).
; magnitude : Roughly the number of animations one anticipates
; frames-per-second : Frames per second
; type : The frame type; one of e.g. "png", "jpg"

               ,(format "type=~a:fps=~a" type frames-per-second)

                  animation
                  (make-pathname (current-directory) animation ".avi")))))
    (values next-frame finalize)))

==== Examples
In this hypothetical example, we're running a
depth-first-search on a graph; outputting an animation frame every step.
 (receive (next-frame finalize) (make-animator)
   (let ((graph (make-random-graph)))
     (call-for-each-frame (depth-first-search graph)
                          (lambda (graph)
                            (write-graph-as-png graph (next-frame))))
     (finalize "graph")))
